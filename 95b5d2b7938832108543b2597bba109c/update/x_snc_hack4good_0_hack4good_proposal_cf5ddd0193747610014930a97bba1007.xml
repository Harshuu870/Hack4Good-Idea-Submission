        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>A technology-driven Donation and Asset Distribution Tracker built on ServiceNow could:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Centralize and automate tracking of donation inflows and resource allocations.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enhance transparency and donor confidence by providing real-time visibility into asset movement and use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Minimize manual data errors and reduce administrative workload significantly.</p>

<p>Enable compliance through audit trails and detailed reporting for donors and regulatory bodies.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Accelerate response times for resource distribution during crises.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Measurable impact might include up to <strong>60% reduction</strong> in administrative effort, <strong>improved donor retention</strong> rates through transparent reporting, and <strong>faster distribution</strong> cycles that increase beneficiary satisfaction.​</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Nonprofit organizations face significant challenges in managing donations and asset distribution due to manual processes, fragmented data, and limited transparency. Current systems often rely on spreadsheets, paper records, or disparate tools, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and lack of accountability. Donors and stakeholders frequently lack trust due to difficulties tracking where and how donations are utilized. This opacity also hampers effective reporting and compliance with funding requirements. The absence of real-time tracking impairs timely distribution of resources, particularly in emergencies when speed and accuracy are critical.</problem_statement>
